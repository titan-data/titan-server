# Titan Docker Server

This repository contains the docker container that is used by the
[Titan](https://github.com/titan-data/titan) data management tool. This docker container
provides all the repository operations necessary to support titan-powered containers, along with 
remote providers to push & and pull data between repositories. For information on the Titan
project and community, see [titan-data.io](https://titan-data.io).

This is an internal dependency of Titan, and should never need to be run by itself.
