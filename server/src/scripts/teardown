# This script will teardown any underlying ZFS infrastructure that we may have installed on the
# host VM. It should be invoked with the same arguments as the launch script, and will do the
# following:
#
#   * Destroy the ZFS pool if it exists
#   * Undo any bind mounts
#   * Uninstall ZFS modules, if we were responsible for installing them in the first place
#   * Remove the local, including the underlying datafile
#
# It should be run as part of 'titan uninstall', as well as after endtoend tests.
